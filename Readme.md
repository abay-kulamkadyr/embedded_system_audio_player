## Embedded Systems Project with BeagleBone Green, Zen Cape, and Adafruit NeoTrellis 4x4 Led Button Matrix.   

System Explanation:
Our system is an iteractive audio player implementation. It allows us to play audio files through the
Beagleboneâ€™s audio output jack and manipulates the wav files by adding additional wave files on
top. 
Some features enabled by our system are a follows:
* playing wav files
* playing back sound effects when the buttons on the LED Matrix are pressed 
* skipping through files using joystick and accelerometer
* Reversing and Forwarding through tracks
* Pause/Unpause feature
* Forwarding/Reversing while wav file is paused/playing
* control volume using the potentiometer
* display audio wav file progress on the 14 seg display
* Using embedded node server to control the features on the Beaglebone
* Playing/Pausing/Forwarding/Reversing buttons rendered through web server
* Displaying track currently being played on terminal
* Allow audio recording using a mic
* Displaying leds animation on the 4 x 4 matrix led display
